      <h2>1.<u>Sahastradhara</u></h2>
      <p>Sahastradhara is famous for its medicinal & therapeutic value as its water contains sulphur. As a first timer to the town, we visited the place in June'22 despite our cab driver's reluctance.</p>
      <p>You can visit Sahastradhara all year round. Being a hill station, it experiences pleasant weather throughout the year, but if you want to see the waterfalls in full momentum, it is best to visit Dehradun from May to August.</p>
      <p>The visitors need to pay a nominal entry fee of Rs. 250 to Rs. 300 (per person) to go on a ropeway ride. It is open every week from 9 am to 6 pm.</p>

        <p>Guchu Pani or Robber's cave, whatever you may call it, this cave was a route for robbers to seek refuge during the British era. But you can take refuge in the caves for some time and enjoy the waterfalls and icy cold streams flowing in the narrow channel.

        <h2>3.<u>Rajaji National Park</u></h2>
        <p>Spread over a wide area, the Rajaji National Park is a dream place for all nature and animal lovers. You will get to witness a wide population of elephants, panthers, and birds here. While you enjoy the company of your new friends, you can take in the scintillating view of the Shivalik range. The park is an amalgamation of three sanctuaries- Rajaji, Motichur, and Chilla, which explains the sheer size of the estate and gives you ample opportunities to explore the wild. It is a close second to Jim Corbett park in terms of tiger reservation, which is also present in Uttarakhand! So to spend a few hours amidst mother nature and her children, be sure to visit the park and create some unforgettable memories.</p>
